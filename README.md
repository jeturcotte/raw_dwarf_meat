# raw_dwarf_meat


just some stupid public repo of modified raw files for dwarf fortress

... for now, this ONLY includes modified files.

# Wish list:

* Pegmatite veins and proper gem association with them
* Corrections re: mass/melting points for new minerals in 0.1.0 and 0.1.1
* Implementation of some better tileset graphics from Kafine

# Change log:

## version 0.1.2

* rescued some of Kafine's good graphics and redistributed them in a more advanceable way.  This will make it easier to fill out gaps, and perhaps even wend our way to a complete kafine tileset that can run indepedently from others if desired... you know, someday.
* modified one phoebus and one kohaku file to comment out the replaced items just in case you are using the phoebus tileset (which kafine's work is in, but was, in turn, heavily commented out.)

## version 0.1.1

* fixed up the whole 'cold' star thing across all files and languages
* added DECEIVE, DIRK, AEGIS, KRYSS, and KEEP (noun) to all languages and symbolisms
* added CHALCOPYRITE and BORNITE as rarer and more colurful copper/iron ore morphologies

## version 0.1.0

* Added azurite and covellite (colorful varieties/pseudomorphs of malachite)
* Added meteorite (in two forms, 'ancient' fallen star and 'cold star' (for a more recent meteorite))
* Added the Aegis (a larger shield)
* Added the Dirk (narrow slender dagger)
* Added the Kryss (serpentine wavy dagger)
* Adjusted which races can use these (also goblin blow-gunners)
* Added a few words to the langauges (magma, lava, various gems and minerals, etc)
* Added a few more food descriptors
