# raw_dwarf_meat

  * AMPHIBIAN
  * OLM (toad, frog already present)

## version 0.1.11 ~~ 'further vocabulary III'

## version 0.1.10 ~~ 'better vocabulary I'

* um... so... yeah
  * I went through the ENTIRE language file and fixed things ups
  * It's not complete, but it is MORE complete than the originals
  * There may be some err

  * APPROXIMATE
  * LEGAL
  * ILLEGAL
  * CRIME
  * CRIMINAL
  * COURT
  * COURTSHIP

## version 0.1.8 ~~ 'further vocabulary I'

* on a whim, decided to add to the language files:
  * Buttes (the flat topped hills)
  * Contracts (legal AND physical)
  * Expansions (physical)
  * Crags
  * Forges

## version 0.1.7 ~~ 'of sweeping changes and deer'

* added a lot of toys as well as some made by Kafine
* added new pants by Kafine
* added halla, white-tailed, and moose with standard, dread, holy, and giant versions
* fixed up creature variations AND style of creature development for easier moving forward
* retired the idea of titanic creatures
* fixed a slew of small bugs in creature coloration
* fixed application of jasper minerals to sedimentary layers

## version 0.1.6 ~~ 'the first amphibian'

* added 'true frog' (Ranidae) generic construct
  * added the WOOD frog as the first speciation of this construct, along with concurrent graphics
  * the process of this creation is detailed in a youtube tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyAuIfajzFg

## version 0.1.5 ~~ 'up with 2014!'

* fixed entity_default.txt to be compatible with DF2014

## version 0.1.4 ~~ 'dread titanic wild holy birds'

* added WILDS and WILDERNESS to all languages and symbolism
* massively altered GIANT creature variation (probably toning their size down a bit)
* added DREAD, HOLY, and TITANTIC (probably bigger than old giant variants, rare, and prone to claiming lairs) creature variations
* created a more modular way to define a base 'mythically generic' creature from which procedural species (and their creature variations) can be derived
  * added 'thrush' family of birds in this manner
    * added ROBIN, DUSKY THRUSH, and VEERY species and their corresponding nonhumanoid variations

## version 0.1.3 ~~ 'feldspar'

* added FELDSPAR (which is a primary constituent of most ROCK but also a mineral unto itself (like quartz or mica, etc))
* added AMAZONITE (which is a varity of feldspar, just like but somewhat greener than microcline)
* added FELDSPAR, MICROCLINE, AMAZONITE, and ORTHOCLASE to all languages and symbolisms
* altered DEAD STAR again to be FORGED STAR instead... sorry about the indecision
* tentatively removed the ability to play as a goblin in adventure mode until more comfortable with those configs

## version 0.1.2 ~~ 'kafine restoration'

* rescued some of Kafine's good graphics and redistributed them in a more advanceable way.  This will make it easier to fill out gaps, and perhaps even wend our way to a complete kafine tileset that can run indepedently from others if desired... you know, someday.
* modified one phoebus and one kohaku file to comment out the replaced items just in case you are using the phoebus tileset (which kafine's work is in, but was, in turn, heavily commented out.)

## version 0.1.1 ~~ 'speaking of which'

* fixed up the whole 'cold' star thing across all files and languages
* added DECEIVE, DIRK, AEGIS, KRYSS, and KEEP (noun) to all languages and symbolisms
* added CHALCOPYRITE and BORNITE as rarer and more colurful copper/iron ore morphologies

## version 0.1.0 ~~ 'of copper and conflict'

* Added azurite and covellite (colorful varieties/pseudomorphs of malachite)
* Added meteorite (in two forms, 'ancient' fallen star and 'cold star' (for a more recent meteorite))
* Added the Aegis (a larger shield)
* Added the Dirk (narrow slender dagger)
* Added the Kryss (serpentine wavy dagger)
* Adjusted which races can use these (also goblin blow-gunners)
* Added a few words to the langauges (magma, lava, various gems and minerals, etc)
* Added a few more food descriptors
